Anomaly detection in financial markets is a critical task that involves identifying unusual patterns or events in
market data, such as stock prices, trading volumes, or other financial indicators. Detecting anomalies can help
traders and financial institutions make informed decisions, spot potential market manipulation, or avoid unexpected
financial losses.


Input Data:
Historical Market Data: This includes data on stock prices, trading volumes, bid-ask spreads, volatility, and other relevant
financial indicators. The data should cover a significant time period to capture different market conditions.


Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning and formatting the data, handling missing values, and possibly scaling or normalizing the data for uniformity.


Anomaly Detection Algorithm:
Apply an anomaly detection algorithm to the preprocessed data. In this example, we'll use the Isolation Forest algorithm,
 a tree-based method for detecting anomalies.


Threshold Setting:
Decide on a threshold for anomaly detection. Data points that score above this threshold are considered anomalies.


Output:
The output typically includes a list of detected anomalies, along with their timestamps and possibly severity scores.


The Isolation Forest algorithm is an anomaly detection algorithm used in machine learning and data mining.


Attributes of Dataset:
Date: This column represents the date of the financial data point, indicating when the data was recorded. Dates are
important for tracking the chronological order of financial events and for time-series analysis.

Open: The "Open" price refers to the price of a financial instrument (e.g., a stock) at the beginning of a trading period,
 such as the opening price of a stock when the market opens for the day.

High: The "High" price represents the highest price reached by the financial instrument during a trading period. It is
the maximum price at which the asset traded during that period.

Low: The "Low" price is the opposite of the high price. It represents the lowest price reached by the financial
instrument during a trading period, indicating the minimum price at which the asset traded.

Close: The "Close" price represents the price of the financial instrument at the end of a trading period, such as the
closing price of a stock when the market closes for the day. It is often used as a reference point for tracking a financial
instrument's performance over time.

Adj Close (Adjusted Close): The "Adjusted Close" price takes into account events such as dividends, stock splits, or other
corporate actions that can affect the price of a stock. It provides a more accurate representation of the investment's
value over time.

Volume: The "Volume" column typically represents the total number of shares or units of a financial instrument traded
during a specific trading period. It indicates the level of market activity and liquidity for that instrument during
that time.
